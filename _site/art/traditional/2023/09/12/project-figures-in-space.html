<p>Done as my first project at Harford Community College for my Studio Drawing 2 class. Linework was initially done in procreate. Linework on final version was done with posca. Multiple sheets of Dura-Lar and Dura-Lar Matte are overlayed. Each layer has different things on the front and back. Used gouache , acryllic paint, color pencils, and oil pastel.
