I am a trans woman. I am queer. I am [neurodivergent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurodiversity). Living at the intersection of these identities is not easy. However, I strongly believe that any trial I endure only equips me to better serve others. As long as I am living and surviving, I will use what I have been through to better understand and be empathetic towards others.


My community is my family. I am committed to support all queer, trans, and neurodivergent people. Many of my community members call me mom -- because I'm always looking out for them -- whether by cooking them food, giving advice, or just being an ear or a shoulder.


I'm always looking for more ways to support my community. From 2016 to 2021 I worked with The Baltimore Transgender Alliance to advocate for trans folks in Baltimore. Other projects I've worked on are the Baltimore Trans Ladies' Picnic, a trans clothing closet , Bmore Trans, Generation T, as well as volunteering my time for various advocacy organizations.
