I’m a queer, trans and neurodivergent artist. I am a woman. I use art and programming to advocate for my community and analyze systems of oppression. I also design neat patterns.


**My community is my family.** And I have a strong passion to support all queer, trans, and neurodivergent people. I am on a lifelong journey – constantly learning and gaining new skills to support them.


In 2013, I graduated from St. Mary’s College of Maryland with a degree in computer science, and a minor in neuroscience. I’ve been a Baltimore native since then.
