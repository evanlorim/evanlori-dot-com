In 2013 - I graduated from St. Mary's College of Maryland with a degree in computer science. In college I was highly motivated by the application of computer science to my other studies -- psychology and neuroscience. I specialized in cognitive science and data science.


Over the past 9 years; however, I have learned to combine my skills in art and design with those in programming. I taught myself, and learned through work experience, how to do web design and full stack development. More recently I have taken that even further -- to create art with my code; generative art. I've been working on generating the patterns which I draw and see in the world with code.
