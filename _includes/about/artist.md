I have been making art my entire life. I love learning new ways to create and express myself. I use whatever media I have at-hand to create: digital, pen, pencil, markers, yarn, found objects.  

I have a special interest in patterns, specifically, repetitive patterns with small incremental changes. The patterns which I see in the world I draw, and the patterns which I draw I see in the world. My drawing is meditative and reflective.

I use art as a tool in my activism. For the past 12 years or so I've been making designs, posters and buttons for the various projects and causes I've been involved with. From 2016 to 2021 I worked as media specialist for [The Baltimore Transgender Alliance](https://www.bmoretransalliance.com). My art is also an act of empowerment -- for myself and my community.
